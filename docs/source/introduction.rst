Introduction
=====================================

DjPandora is an application that interfaces with ``pypandora``. The premise is to allow a group of people to control a single Pandora installation. The idea came about as a way for our office to control the office Pandora radio setup. This will allow users in the office to vote on songs, stations, and so on to control Pandora as an overall group.
